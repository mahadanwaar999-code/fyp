        content: { en: `The nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, is a large evergreen native to the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, of Indonesia. It is important as the source of two spices derived from the fruit: nutmeg and mace.\n\n[A] Nutmeg is the seed of the tree, roughly egg-shaped and about 20 to 30 mm long and 15 to 18 mm wide, and weighing between 5 and 10 g dried, while mace is the dried "lacy" reddish covering or aril of the seed. The first harvest of nutmeg trees takes place 7–9 years after planting, and the trees reach full production after twenty years. Nutmeg is usually used in powdered form.\n\n[B] In the Middle Ages, nutmeg was used as a preservative and for medicinal purposes. It was extremely expensive in Europe. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) fought to control the trade. In the 16th century, European nations took control of the nutmeg trade. In the 17th century, demand for nutmeg grew as it was believed to be effective against disease. Following the Treaty of Breda, the Dutch had control of all the islands where nutmeg grew.`, zh: "肉豆蔻树..." },

Figures from the Transport Research Laboratory indicate that most motor accidents are partly due to human error, so the introduction of driverless vehicles will result in greater safety.\n\n[A] In addition to the direct benefits of automation, it may bring other advantages. For example, schemes for car sharing will be more workable, especially in towns and cities, resulting in fewer cars on the road. According to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, there could be a 43 percent drop in car ownership. However, this would mean that the yearly mileage of each car would, on average, be twice as high as it currently is. This would lead to a higher turnover of vehicles, and therefore no reduction in automotive manufacturing.\n\n[B] Efficiency gains are also expected. Adaptive cruise control, which is already available on many cars, allows vehicles to maintain a safe distance from one another. This technology reduces traffic congestion and improves fuel economy.`, zh: "汽车工程师认为..." },
